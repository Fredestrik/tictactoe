This repo shows an example of TicTacToe made with React. The board is composed of 3x3 cases and the two players are **X** and **O**. The first player with 3 contiguous cases occupied by its pieces wins.

An aside paragraph gives the player who has to play next and the name of the winner if relevant. The player is can restart the game if wanted.
